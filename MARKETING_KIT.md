**First Comment:**
```
👋 Hi Product Hunt!

I built Lakshami Contractors to solve a problem I saw firsthand: contractors spending hours on paperwork instead of doing what they love.

**What makes it different:**
• 100% Mac-native (SwiftUI)
• Keyboard-first design (⌘K command palette)
• No subscription ($29 one-time)
• Works offline (all data stored locally)
• Professional-grade PDF exports

**Who it's for:**
Independent contractors, small contracting businesses, handymen, home improvement pros, and anyone who needs to create estimates and track jobs.

**Tech Stack:**
Built with SwiftUI, using @Observable for state management, PDFKit for exports, AVFoundation for camera, and CoreImage for photo editing.

I'd love to hear your feedback! What features would you like to see? What would make this more useful for you?

Thanks for checking it out! 🏗️
