### Long Description (300 words)

QuoteHub represents the next generation of contractor management software, purpose-built for macOS and designed with the modern contractor in mind. Whether you're a kitchen remodeler, roofing specialist, or general contractor, QuoteHub eliminates the administrative burden that keeps you from focusing on what you do best—building.

The application's standout feature is its AI-powered camera estimation system. Simply take photos of a project site, and QuoteHub's artificial intelligence generates accurate estimates instantly, eliminating hours of manual measurements and calculations. For contractors who prefer traditional methods, QuoteHub offers eight professionally-crafted templates covering everything from kitchen remodels to HVAC installations, each fully customizable to your specific needs.

Payment tracking has never been simpler. QuoteHub automatically calculates remaining balances as you record payments, supports all major payment methods (cash, check, credit card, Venmo, Zelle), and maintains a complete payment history for every job. Need to send an invoice? Generate a professional, branded PDF and email it directly to your client—all without leaving the app.

For busy contractors juggling multiple projects, bulk operations let you mark multiple jobs complete, export data for several projects, or clean up old estimates in seconds. The integrated analytics dashboard provides real-time insights into your business performance, tracking total revenue, active job value, completion rates, and payment status.

Built exclusively for macOS, QuoteHub leverages Apple's latest technologies to deliver a fast, secure, and beautifully designed experience. The app follows Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, supports both light and dark modes, and includes full VoiceOver accessibility for vision-impaired users.

Whether you're a solo contractor or managing a small team, QuoteHub scales with your business—from the free tier supporting up to 10 active jobs to the Pro plan offering unlimited jobs with AI features and advanced analytics.
