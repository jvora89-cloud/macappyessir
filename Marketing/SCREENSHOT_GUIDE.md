## Design Best Practices

### Visual Consistency
- Use same sample data across screenshots where possible
- Maintain consistent window size
- Keep UI theme consistent (all Light or all Dark)
- Use same font rendering settings

### Readability
- Ensure 16px+ font sizes are clear
- High contrast for text
- Avoid busy backgrounds
- Keep focus on primary feature

### Storytelling
- Order screenshots to tell a journey
- Start with overview, drill into features
- End with power features
- Each screenshot should standalone

### App Store Optimization
- First 2-3 screenshots are most important (above fold on mobile)
- Use captions strategically
- Show actual UI, not marketing graphics
- Demonstrate real value proposition

## Caption Writing Guidelines

**Format:**
- 30-60 characters max per caption
- Focus on benefit, not feature
- Use action words
- End without punctuation (cleaner look)

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:** "This is the dashboard where you can see jobs"
✅ **Good:** "Your business at a glance - revenue, jobs, and progress"

❌ **Bad:** "Job detail view with many features"
✅ **Good:** "Track every detail from estimate to final payment"

❌ **Bad:** "You can export to PDF"
✅ **Good:** "Professional estimates that impress clients"
