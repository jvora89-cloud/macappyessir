# QuoteHub Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** February 2026

## Introduction

QuoteHub ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use QuoteHub, our macOS application for contractor estimate management.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide
- **Client Information:** Names, phone numbers, email addresses, and physical addresses of your clients
- **Job Details:** Project descriptions, cost estimates, payment records, progress notes
- **Business Information:** Your company name and business type (if provided in settings)
- **Photos:** Images you import for job documentation

### Automatically Collected Information
- **Device Information:** macOS version, app version
- **Usage Data:** Feature usage patterns, error logs (if crash reporting is enabled)
- **Local Storage:** All data is stored locally on your Mac in your user directory

## How We Use Your Information

QuoteHub processes your information to:
- Store and manage your client and job information locally
- Generate PDF estimates and invoices
- Provide AI-powered cost estimation (when Claude API key is provided)
- Sync your theme preferences across app launches
- Improve app functionality and user experience

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage
- All your data is stored **locally on your Mac** in:
  - `~/Library/Application Support/macappyessir/jobs.json`
  - `~/Library/Application Support/macappyessir/JobPhotos/`
- We do NOT store your data on our servers
- You maintain full control over your data

### Third-Party Services

**Claude AI (Optional):**
- If you provide a Claude API key, job descriptions are sent to Anthropic's Claude API for cost estimation
- This is optional - the app works without an API key using smart fallback estimation
- Anthropic's privacy policy applies to data sent to their API: https://www.anthropic.com/privacy
- We do not store or transmit your API key beyond your local machine

### Security Measures
- App runs in macOS sandbox for enhanced security
- No network access required for core functionality
- Data is encrypted by macOS FileVault (if enabled on your system)

## Data Sharing

We do NOT:
- Sell your personal information
- Share your data with third parties (except Claude API when you opt-in)
- Use your data for advertising
- Access your data remotely

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- **Access:** View all your data within the app
- **Modify:** Edit or delete any job, client, or payment information
- **Export:** Generate PDF estimates and invoices
- **Delete:** Remove the app and all data by deleting the application and its support files
- **Portability:** Your data is stored in standard JSON format for easy export

## Data Retention

- Data persists until you manually delete it within the app
- Uninstalling the app does not automatically delete data files
- To completely remove all data, delete: `~/Library/Application Support/macappyessir/`

## Children's Privacy

QuoteHub is intended for business use and is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.
